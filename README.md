Welcome this is my portfolio. I did some research and found some handy license for free of use that developers provide and make the development process better and easier. It allows me to get everything done a little bit quicker as well. I had used a bit of stuff I learned in my free time and hope this is all acceptable I spent sometime on this and am very proud of the finished product and am looking forward to being able to add more to this project.
